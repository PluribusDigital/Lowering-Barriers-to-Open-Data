# Lowering-Barriers-to-Open-Data
STSI Whitepaper on the technical barriers to publishing government data sets.

### Draft Status: Initial Rough Outline
This report is just getting started, with the first anticipated complete version in early 2015.

# Outline

## The Three Gates to Open Data
The act of opening up a dataset requires passing through three gates.

1. **Value:** The data owner must see the compelling need to provide a dataset. This can be on philosophical grounds ("the public has a right to know") or practical grounds ("I'm tired of fielding requests for information").
2. **Policy:** The organization must have the legal and internal policy standing to release the information. This includes "hard-stop" issues such as privacy protection, as well as "soft-stop" issues such as an unwillingness to publish a dataset that is likely to soon grow stale.
3. **Technology:** The organization must have the technical capability to publish the dataset, and ideally do so in accordance with best practice. Dropping a CSV file into a content management system is better than nothing, but API documentation, metadata, query capability, and multiple formats (JSON, XML, etc.) are preferrable.

This report focuses primarily on the Technology gate.
