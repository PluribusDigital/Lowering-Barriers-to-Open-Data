### Could you describe your organization's open data efforts?

### What is your biggest open data success story? Your highest-value datasets?

### How many more datasets will your organization publish in the next year?

### Is policy or technology the biggest barrier to publishing data?

### Other than the areas that we've drilled into, do you have any big unanswered questions related to open data?

### Closing/Housekeeping
* May we quote you in the report?
* If we come up with additional specific followup questions, would you be willing to take a short call?
* Is there anyone else you recommend we speak with - either in your organization or outside?
