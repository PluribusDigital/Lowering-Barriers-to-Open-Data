### Interview Confidentiality
* All interviews are off the record until the interviewee gives permission otherwise (e.g. for quotes, etc.)

### Short Answer
* Is there a Chief Data Officer (or similar) role in your organization? (i.e. someone charged with the enterprise-wide responsibility to drive open data efforts)
* How many datasets are available on data.gov?
* How many datasets will your organization publish in the next year?

### Could you describe your organization's open data efforts? Current state, future ambitions?

### What is your biggest open data success story? Your highest-value datasets?

### Is policy or technology the biggest barrier to publishing data?

### Other than the areas that we've drilled into, do you have any big unanswered questions related to open data?

### Closing/Housekeeping
* May we quote you in the report?
* May we make these interview notes available as reference material in our report?
* If we come up with additional specific followup questions, would you be willing to take a short call?
* Is there anyone else you recommend we speak with - either in your organization or outside?
