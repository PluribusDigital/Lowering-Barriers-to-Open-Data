<div class="highlight-pullout">Supporting open data is the most critical piece to maximizing citizen utility of the data.</div>

Once the data is in the "wild", in some ways the most important work is just beginning. Engaging the community, maintaining data quality, answering usersâ€™ questions, providing support around a data set, incorporating customer feedback are all important tasks to achieve the policy set by the White House.

#### Engaging the community. 

Agencies have established a successful blueprint for engaging users through datapaloozas and hackathons. An excellent example is the annual Health Datapalooza that has had over 2000 attendees per event. Another way administrators have found success is by engaging industry thought leaders. Similiar to hackathons, there are online competitions like Challenge.gov and kaggle.com where agencies can challenge the public to solve a problem or improve on existing solutions.

#### Answering questions. 

There are public question and answer sites like opendata.stackexchange.com. These sites have been extremely popular for professional and hobbyists developers to interact. Users can build reputation points by answering questions and asking questions or performing other beneficial tasks like editing questions. Having data creators participate in these forums can increase uptake of different datasets.

#### Capturing feedback.

Many administrators we talked to cited obtaining feedback and engaging the community of data end users as key challenges. The promise of open data is that: if you make it available, anyone can make something great and unexpected from your data. However, this means that the target user is by definition unexpected. Agencies struggle to connect with those target developers and innovators who will do something great with the data. 

There are a variety of platforms for direct user support, both hosted and self-hosted. Some of the popular hosted platforms are desk.com, zoho.com, and zendesk.com. Data.gov is adding some basic functions around customer support. Customer support software also has the advantage that it can provide portal-like benefits for users where data owners can provide additional documentation related to the datasets. Also, questions can be shared and upvoted publicly so that data creators do not have to answer the same questions repeatedly. 

Using source control management (SCM) - One of the tools increasingly used by the public sector is hosted source control management (SCM). SCM is most useful for managing the code used to manipulate data and the documentation for the data. SCM does not typically host the data itself. SCM comes in different flavors with Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial (Hg) all being open source favorites with developer. Git and its popular hosted incarnation, GitHub, currently have the greatest mindshare of users and attention. These hosted SCM platforms have issue trackers, documentation and wikis built-in to increase collaboration between creators and users. More and more, data scientists are also using these hosted platforms to open their code publicly.
