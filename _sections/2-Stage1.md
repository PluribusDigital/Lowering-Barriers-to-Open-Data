Before releasing open data, the agency identifies which datasets should be published -- or even what data exists. They establish internal governance controls to make sure the process maintains momentum.

#### Identify Data

Most agencies have completed a first pass of identifying data sources to comply with administrative orders. Now is the time to take stock of what additional data might add value. You may find uncollected, mission additive data that could be released by answering the following questions:

 - What is the current **index** of organizational data and where is that data maintained (e.g., healthdata.gov)?
 - In budget documents, such as OMB Exhbit 300 filings, what are the largest **budget items** and what data is associated with them?
 - What **[unstructured data][3]** (e.g., pdfs, Word files) exists? Where are the biggest IT storage uses and what are the largest file repositories?
 - What are the **databases** that your agency maintains? What are the transactions in those systems?
 - What **Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests** are you receiving? In our discussions with administrators, we found that FOIA requests are often welcomed as part of the process of releasing open data. Releasing data by default can reduce the administrative burden (and cost) of fielding FOIA requests. Can you operationalize the most valuable requests?

#### Prioritize Data Sets

Once data is discovered, captured and indexed, it must be prioritized. Assigning value and weighing hundreds or thousands of datasets against one another is difficult. Fortunately, the European Union (E.U.) has been exploring these same issues and have written about methods for prioritization.
The paper titled “Value-based Prioritisation of Open Government Data Investments” by Leda Bargiotti, et. al explains how to use a “star” based system of prioritizing data. In short, your agency should take its index of datasets and assign each one a star based on specific dimensions to your agency.
Borrowing from the E.U. and incorporating the White House executive order, a starting set of dimensions are:

- **Obligation** -- data required by law or other binding requirement.
- **Economic/Social benefit** -- data that creates dollar or time savings, improves quality of life, improves health outcomes, creates new jobs, etc. 
- **Innovation** -- data that could lead to new areas of development (e.g. allowing the civilian use of GPS signals or weather data).
- **Accountability** -- increase transparency regarding how budgets are used or results of contracting awards.
- **Citizen interest** -- popularity with users based on inquiries like the number of FOIA requests made, or signatures to a petition.

#### Create Internal Accountability

Many sources of open data are byproducts mission-oriented work, but data creators may not proactively release valuable datasets. Our discussions with leading administrators surfaced that agencies have had success identifying data “captains” that collaborate horizontally on managing open data within an agency’s internal communities. Captains perform the role of helping data creators make open data the “default”, share best practices and build accountability.
Another simple tactic administrators cited for spurring the release of data is creating release calendars for high priority data. This creates a roadmap for data owners and administrators to plan for and follow.
