title: Stage 1 - Plan

Before releasing open data, the agency identifies which datasets should be published -- or even what data exists. They establish internal governance controls to make sure the process maintains momentum.

#### Identifying data. 

Most agencies have completed a first pass of identifying data sources to comply with administrative orders. Now is the time to take stock of what data additional data might add value. You may find uncollected, mission additive data that could be released by answering the following questions:
 
 - What is the current index of organizational data and where is that data maintained (e.g., healthdata.gov)?
 - In budget documents, such as OMB Exhbit 300 filings, what are the largest budget items and what data is associated with them?
 - What unstructured data (e.g., pdfs, Word files) exists? Where are the biggest IT storage uses and what are the largest file repositories?
 - Structured data (i.e., databases) - What are the databases that your agency maintains? What are the transactions in those systems?
 - What Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests are you receiving? In our discussions with administrators, we found that FOIA requests are often welcomed as part of the process of releasing open data. Can you operationalize the most valuable requests?

#### Prioritizing data sets. 

Once data is discovered, captured and indexed, it must be prioritized. Assigning value and weighing hundreds or thousands of datasets against one another is difficult. Fortunately, the European Union (E.U.) has been exploring these same issues and have written about methods for prioritization. 
The paper titled “Value-based Prioritisation of Open Government Data Investments” by Leda Bargiotti, et. al explains how to use a “star” based system of prioritizing data. In short, your agency should take its index of datasets and assign each one a star based on specific dimensions to your agency.
Borrowing from the E.U. and incorporating the White House executive order, a starting set of dimensions are: 

- Legal or administrative obligation to disclose -- data required by law or other binding requirement.
- Economic benefit & social good -- data that creates dollar or time savings, improves quality, or creates new jobs. Social good could be data that improves health outcomes or quality of life.
- Innovation -- data that could lead to new areas of development (e.g. allowing the civilian use of GPS signals or weather data).
- Accountability & transparency -- how budgets are used or results of contracting awards.
- Citizen interest -- popularity with users based on inquiries like the number of FOIA requests made, or signatures to a petition.

#### Creating internal accountability. 

Many sources of open data are byproducts mission-oriented work. Many data creators may not proactively release valuable datasets. Our discussions with leading administrators surfaced that agencies have had success identifying data “captains” that collaborate horizontally on managing open data within an agency’s internal communities. Captains perform the role of helping data creators make open data the “default”, share best practices and build accountability.
Another simple tactic administrators cited for spurring the release of data is creating release calendars for high priority data. This creates a roadmap for data owners and administrators to plan for and follow.
