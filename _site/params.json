{"name":"Lowering Barriers to Open Data","tagline":"STSI report on the technical barriers to publishing government data sets","body":"# Lowering-Barriers-to-Open-Data\r\nThe paper (working title: “Lowering Barriers to Open Data”) explores the challenges that US Federal Government organizations face when it comes to publishing more and better data. We are working to discover the specific barriers and also share how some agencies are handling/solving those issues today.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of open data, we are developing this report in the open. Although quite rough at first, you can browse through the emerging outline and contents as we build it.\r\n\r\n### Draft Status: Initial Rough Outline\r\nThis report is just getting started, with the first anticipated complete version in early 2015.\r\nThe current draft is in the [report](https://github.com/STSILABS/Lowering-Barriers-to-Open-Data/blob/master/report/index.md) folder.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you have an issue or idea related to the report, please log an issue. \r\n\r\n### Whitepaper/Interview Logistics\r\nInterviews are confidential.
