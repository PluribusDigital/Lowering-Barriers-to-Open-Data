### Interview Confidentiality
- All interviews are off the record until the interviewee gives permission otherwise (e.g. for quotes, etc.)

### Short Answer
- Is there a Chief Data Officer (or similar) role in your organization? (i.e. someone charged with the enterprise-wide responsibility to drive open data efforts)
 - Yes. There are CDOs at the sub-agency levels like CMS.
- How many datasets are available on data.gov?
 - 818 datasets on data.gov.
 - Also, revamping the healthdata.gov website.

### How does HHS engage with users and developers (e.g., datapalooza)?
- Followed model of NOAA, which had success by publishing geospatial data. Along with GPS data, they have spawned whole industries.
- The size of the healthcare market is large and attacts a lot of interest.
- Data transparencey is the key.
- Invited key stakeholders, like Tim O'Reilly, to be involved with the challenge and opportunity.
- Created competitions, hack-a-thons with prizes.
- The famous Bill Joy quote is relevant to open data: ["If you rely solely on your own employees, you’ll never solve all your customers’ needs."](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1126/031.html)


### The McKinsey Global Institute estimated open health data could reduce healthcare costs by $300-450B annually. What is HHS doing for public open data to help capture more of that savings?
- Medicare could go bankrupt if we can’t find better ways to deliver (double-digit inflation in cost of care)
- There are lots of opportunities to save money from open data.
- Delivery system reform efforts – shifting medicare payment strategies; moving from paper to structured experience (bundled care, shared savings programs, etc.)


### Are there hidden datasets?
- No. But there are a lot of datasets that are unutilized or underutilized.
- Secretary Sebelius captured it best by saying "Our goal then – and our goal today – is to convert our [“lazy data” into “active data”][1] – to push it into the public domain for the common good."
- HHS is focused more on data quality:
 - CMS creates more part D data.
 - Started doing quality ratings.
- HHS is working on improving the meta data and context of data.
  - Employee knowledge around programs is key – HHS needs to be able to capture that.

### Is policy or technology the greater barrier to publishing data? Are there technology problems/solutions out there that could make it more efficient to publish data?
- HHS does not see many tech. barriers. There are some challenges.
 - Security: "Open Data adovates are guardians are the information and privacy/confidentiality is job 1."
- Policy's issues a often the most difficult to resolved.
- In the near term, HHS cannot publish data automaticaly.
- Simple technology like shared calendars of data releases can be very useful.
- There has been some progress on electronic redaction software.


### What role do FOIA requests play in open data?
- It's an important role. If one group or person has a question, it's likely that others do to.
- Open government might not lead to a decrease in FOIA requests. Once people get a taste for more info, it may yield more requests.


### Other than the areas that we've drilled into, do you have any big unanswered questions related to open data?
- HHS would like to answer the question of "who's been using the data?"
- HHS is a big department with many sub agencies. For example, FDA and CMS.
- HHS is has data leads spread throughout the department.
 - The leads share best practices.
 - Organization is distributed as opposed to top down.
 - Publish a calendar of release dates.

### How do you overcome the barriers?
- Communicate value creation (e.g., the value of metadata).
- Culture is changing but it's not past the tipping point.
- Thear

### Closing/Housekeeping
- May we quote you in the report?
 - Please contact with potential quotes.
- If we come up with additional specific followup questions, would you be willing to take a short call?
 - Yes.
- Is there anyone else you recommend we speak with - either in your organization or outside?
 - Yes, CMS.
