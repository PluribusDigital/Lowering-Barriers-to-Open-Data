Apparent high-value datasets:
* Crime Solutions Shareable Program Record Widgets: Office of Justice Programs, National Institute of Justice 
  - If you would like to provide your site visitors with access to the program profiles and ratings most recently posted to CrimeSolutions.gov, add one of the available CrimeSolutions.gov program widgets to your site. In addition to the "Latest Programs" widget, topical widgets are also available which provide information about recently posted programs associated with the following topics: Corrections & Reentry, Courts, Crime & Crime Prevention, Drugs & Substance Abuse, Juveniles, Law Enforcement, Technology & Forensics, and Victims.
* National Crime Victimization Survey API: Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics
  - The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) RESTful API is a web service that provides criminal victimization data obtained annually from a nationally representative sample of about 79,800 households and 143,210 persons interviewed each year. NCVS data describe the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimization in the United States. The NCVS provides the largest national forum for victims to describe the impact of crime and characteristics of violent offenders. It is one of two primary data collections about crime in the United States and is the only source of data about crimes not reported to the police. The NCVS API page provides developers with end-points in XML, JSON, and CSV formats along with related codebooks, methodology, metadata and usage instructions.
* ATF Trace Data Report API: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 
  - Each year, ATF's National Tracing Center processes more than 300,000 trace requests for crime guns submitted by federal, state, local and international law enfocement agencies. This data set provides results of those traces, including year of recovery/trace, city/state in which the gun was recovered, type of gun, category of crime associated with the gun, source state for the gun, and time-to-crime rates.

## Possible Format Issues
* Most in HTML Only
* Many "datasets" are actually subsets, e.g.:
  - Federal Justice Statistics Program: Criminal Appeals Cases Filed in Courts of Appeals, 1996 [United States]
  - Federal Justice Statistics Program: Criminal Appeals Cases Filed in Courts of Appeals, 1995 [United States]
* Some are hosted by 3rd parties (http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR24003.v2 redirects to umich.edu NACJD)
* Some are not available for download without further application to access data (e.g. http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/24091/version/2 in NACJD)
* Many report documents are available, that have some data content locked in PDFs
