## Possible Format Issues
* CSV/Zip vs. API
* Some (e.g. SOD) apparently cannot be downloaded in bulk nor as raw data?
* Some (SDI) is only available in pieces (quarter, category of data)
* Some (Trust Institution Search) only serve data as HTML
* RECON has a strange shopping cart feature, serves up images (of charts and tables)
* State profiles are PDF of tabular data per state (can't easily compare states)
* Asset information is not machine readable (easily)
