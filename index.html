<a id="lowering-barriers-to-open-data" class="anchor" href="#lowering-barriers-to-open-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Report Purpose</h1>

<p>This report explores the challenges that US Federal Government organizations face when it comes to publishing more and better data. We identify specific barriers and also share how some agencies are handling/solving those issues today.</p>

<h1>Framing the Issue</h1>
<h2>Why Open Data Matters</h2>
<h2>The Three Gates to Open Data</h2>
<p>The act of opening up a dataset requires passing through three gates.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Value:</strong> The data owner must see the compelling need to provide a dataset. This can be on philosophical grounds ("the public has a right to know") or practical grounds ("I'm tired of fielding requests for information").</li>
  <li> <strong>Policy:</strong> The organization must have the legal and internal policy standing to release the information. This includes "hard-stop" issues such as privacy protection, as well as "soft-stop" issues such as an unwillingness to publish a dataset that is likely to soon grow stale.</li>
  <li><strong>Technology:</strong> The organization must have the technical capability to publish the dataset, and ideally do so in accordance with best practice. Dropping a CSV file into a content management system is better than nothing, but API documentation, metadata, query capability, and multiple formats (JSON, XML, etc.) are preferrable.</li>
</ol>

<p>This report focuses primarily on the Technology gate.</p>

<h2>The Vision: Excellent Technical Implementation of Open Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Available</li>
  <li>Machine readable</li>
  <li>Analyst usable</li>

<h1>Barriers</h1>
<h2>Publishing</h2>
* Gathering
  - Many data owners/creators don't care about data formats, they care about their primary field.
* Publishing
* Hosting
* Feedback
  - All over the map, most commonly email box

<h2>Engaging the Community</h2>
* Initial feedback
  - Comfort level / desire varies by data owner, even within agencies
* Promote usage
  - Hackathons/Datapalooza

<h3>Closing the Feedback Loop</h3>
* Tracking stats
* Feedback tools
  - Github issue tracker
  - other?

<h1>Solutions</h1>

## Using Technology to Break Down Policy Barriers
* PII Masking
